# 🛡️ Security Risk Assessment & Hardening Recommendations  
**Focus:** Risk Assessment · Security Controls · Preventative Measures


---

## 📌 Overview
Following a security incident involving unauthorized data access, a **security risk assessment** was conducted to evaluate existing controls and recommend improvements. The goal of this assessment was to identify practical, high-impact security measures that would reduce the likelihood and impact of future breaches.

---

## 🔍 Assessment Scope
The assessment focused on:
- Preventative security controls
- Access management
- Policy alignment with industry standards
- Reducing exposure to both external and internal threats

---

## 🧰 Recommended Security Controls

### 1️⃣ Firewall Hardening & Encryption
- Update firewall configurations to current best practices
- Implement rules to ensure **encryption of inbound and outbound traffic**
- Regularly review and update firewall rulesets

**Why this matters:**  
The firewall serves as the **first line of defense**, filtering malicious traffic before it reaches internal systems. Proper configuration and regular updates significantly reduce the attack surface.

---

### 2️⃣ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enforce MFA for system and application access
- Apply MFA to both privileged and non-privileged accounts where possible

**Why this matters:**  
MFA adds a critical additional layer of verification, reducing the risk of account compromise even if credentials are exposed or reused.

---

### 3️⃣ Password Policy Aligned with NIST Guidelines
- Establish a formal password policy
- Align password standards with **NIST recommendations**
- Regularly review and update policy requirements

**Why this matters:**  
Weak or outdated password policies increase the risk of unauthorized access, including misuse by former employees or attackers leveraging credential-based attacks.

---

## 📊 Risk Reduction Impact
Implementing these controls:
- Reduces exposure to common attack vectors
- Strengthens identity and access management
- Improves overall security posture
- Mitigates risks from both external attackers and insider threats

---

## 🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Security risk assessment  
- Control selection and prioritization  
- Policy evaluation and improvement  
- Alignment with industry standards (NIST)  
- Clear documentation of security recommendations  

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways
- Preventative controls are critical following a breach
- Defense-in-depth reduces single points of failure
- Policies must evolve alongside threat landscapes
- Technical controls and governance must work together
